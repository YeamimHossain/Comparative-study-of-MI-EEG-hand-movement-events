# Comparative-study-of-MI-EEG-hand-movement-events
Comparison of classification algorithms for motor imagery detection in EEG data. Features were ranked with CFS and reduced via forward selection. SVM, LR, NB, and KNN were evaluated with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. SVM achieved the highest F1-score (70.26%) with reduced complexity, highlighting its potential for broader applications.
